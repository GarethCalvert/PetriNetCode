# PetriNetCode
A C++ Code for Petri net simulations. 

The code was developed for the use in a PhD project supervised by Dr Luis Neves and Prof John Andrews at the University of Nottingham. The project was funded by Network Rail and EPSRC grant reference EP/N50970X/1. 

Petri nets are directed bipartite graphs that are used to model distributed and concurrent systems, and were first presented in Carl Adam Petri's PhD thesis in 1962. Since then they have found uses in many disciplines including Computer Science, Network Analysis, Biology Systems and Reliability Engineering.
